# Research---Prediction-of-Heart-Diseases-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
My journal paper on the use of machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Random Forests in the prediction of the possibility of Heart Diseases. Also used feature selection methods and implemented cross-validation.
